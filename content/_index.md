## Why is this here?

After years of being relatively quiet on the searchable portion of the internet, I would like to be more active in
sharing some of the techniques I have found while tinkering with technology. I have contributed patches to projects
such as wireshark and the terraform AWS provider, have written more lines of proprietary (read, messy startup) code
than I care to admit, and hope to jumpstart my contributions to more liberated technology with this notebook.


This notebook is built with hugo themed with amethyst.
